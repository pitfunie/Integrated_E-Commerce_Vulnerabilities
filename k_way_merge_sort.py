    Wrapper for heap elements.

    This wrapper class isn't just packaging data‚Äîit‚Äôs enabling custom comparison logic for the priority queue.
    Here‚Äôs why it's critical:

    ‚úÖ Tracks origin: It remembers which list each value came from (list_idx) and where it was inside that list
    (elem_idx).
    üß† Facilitates ordering: The __lt__ method tells Python‚Äôs heapq how to prioritize elements‚Äîspecifically,
    compare by the actual value (val), not by object identity.
    üîÅ Drives iteration: It allows the heap to know which element to pull next and where to look for the subsequent
    value in the same list.

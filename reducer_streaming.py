How this works:

Outputs each posting as soon as it is read, separated by commas, without storing all postings in a list.
Each termâ€™s postings are printed on a single line, as soon as the term changes or input ends.
This approach is memory-efficient and suitable for very large posting lists.

    Reads term-posting pairs from standard input (one per line, tab-separated),
    and streams output for each term as postings are read, avoiding large in-memory lists.

    Input format (from stdin):
        term<TAB>docID:pos

    The input is assumed to be sorted by term (e.g., from a k-way merge in MapReduce).

    For each group of postings with the same term:
        - Output the term and its postings as a comma-separated list, streaming as you go.
        - Does not accumulate all postings in memory for a term.
